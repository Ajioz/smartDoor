# This Project is about developing home security with focus on DOOR

Door Security is an open source project intended to secure home, office and public structure!

This repo contains two code versions developed in Arduino, very basic.

The basic code contains `Keypad and FingerPrint`.  

The latest version of the codes contains code to program finger but was commented out due to mcu insufficient flash size,  to have both the keypad and fingerprint in program mode a bigger mcu is required.

In the future this code will be extended to contain 

<ol>
    <li>Smart Camera - ESP32-Cam</li>
    <li>Web and mobile App to replace hardware keypad</li>
    <li>Motion sensor to detect the presence of human</li>
    <li>AWS IoT core for remote control and monitoring</li>
</ol>
